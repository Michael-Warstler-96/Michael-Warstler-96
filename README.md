Hello,
I am Michael-Warstler, a mechanical engineer who pursued a computer programming certificate outside of my regular job. I aspire to solve interesting and complex problems through coding and engineering analysis.

CONTACT INFORMATION:  warstler.michael@gmail.com

CODING LANGUAGES: C, C++, Java

OTHER SKILLS: Algorithms, Data Structures, Software-Development, Object-Oriented Design, Operating Systems

** NOTE **: This is my personal GitHub account. All of the code inside repos has only been commited once. However, while originally working on these projects, there were numerous commits over time. I no longer have access to my original Git account that showed commit logs on these projects, but I have backups of the projects themselves.
      If there was a question/concern about the lack of commits, that is the answer.
