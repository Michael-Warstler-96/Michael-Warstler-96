Hello,
I am Michael-Warstler, a mechanical engineer who pursued a computer programming certificate outside of my regular job. I aspire to solve interesting and complex problems through coding and engineering analysis. This account is used to store former and current projects to highlight coding knowledge, growth, and learning.

CONTACT INFORMATION:  warstler.michael@gmail.com

CODING LANGUAGES: C, C++ (only some for now), Java

OTHER SKILLS: Algorithms, Data Structures, Software-Development and Testing, Object-Oriented Design, Operating Systems

** NOTE **: This is my personal GitHub account. All of the code inside repos has only been commited once. However, while originally working on these projects, there were numerous commits over time. I no longer have access to my original Git account that showed commit logs on these projects, but I have backups of the projects themselves.
      If there was a question/concern about the lack of commits, that is the answer.
