Hello,
I am Michael-Warstler, a mechanical engineer who pursued a computer programming certificate outside of my regular job. I aspire to solve interesting and complex problems through coding and engineering analysis. This account is used to store former and current projects to highlight coding knowledge, growth, and learning.

CONTACT INFORMATION:  warstler.michael@gmail.com
CODING LANGUAGES: C, C++ (only some for now), Java
OTHER SKILLS: Algorithms, Data Structures, Software-Development and Testing, Object-Oriented Design, Operating Systems

** NOTE **: This is my latest personal GitHub account. All of the listed repos have limited commit history. However, while originally working on these projects, there were numerous commits over time. Consistent commits with insightful messages was something I was taught and something I strictly followed. 
            I no longer have access to my original Git account that showed commit logs on these projects, but I have backups of the projects themselves. If there was ever a question/concern about the lack of commits, that is the answer.
