Hello,

I am Michael Warstler, a mechanical engineer who achieved a computer programming certificate outside of my regular job. I aspire to solve interesting and complex problems through coding and engineering analysis. This account is used to store former and current projects to highlight coding knowledge, growth, and learning.

** NOTE ON COMMIT HISTORY **: This is my latest personal GitHub account. Some of the listed repos have limited commit history. However, while originally working on these projects, there were numerous commits over time. Consistent commits with insightful messages was something I was taught and a practice I strictly followed. 
                              I no longer have access to my original Git account that showed commit logs on these projects, but I have backups of the projects themselves. There are some repos with logs folder, which contains a HEAD file showing the commits of that project over time. 
                              Hopefully this explains the lack of commits shown on most of the repos.
